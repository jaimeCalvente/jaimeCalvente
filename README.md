## Welcome to my profile!

I'm Jaime from Spain, I do **Plc programs** 💻 to control process like "**State Machines**", "**Cooling** ❄️ and **Heating** ☀️ Systems", "**Dosing and Mixing**", "**Preasure Control Systems**" and more. I really enjoy working with technologies such us **Tia Portal** and **CodeSys** for Plc programming and motion control. I also have an interest in programming **Arm Robots** with **ABB** and **Fanuc** at the moment. I am open to **keep developing myself** and **very keen to learn** anything and everything in this field.
