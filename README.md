## Welcome to my profile!

I'm Jaime from Spain. I am currently studying my **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science** (Online) at the UOC University in Barcelona. I create **Plc programs** üíª to control process like "**State Machines**", "**Cooling‚ùÑÔ∏è and Heating‚òÄÔ∏è Systems**", "**Dosing and Mixing**", "**Preasure Control Systems**" and much more. I really enjoy working with technologies such us **STEP7**, **TIA PORTAL**, **CODESYS** and **ROCKWELL** for Plc programming and Motion control,followind IEC Standars and using predominantly the **AWL, FUP and SCL** lenguages.

I also have knowledge with programming lenguages such as **C/C++**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS**.

Besides that, I am very keen to **keep developing myself** in anyway, shape or form, so I can give back to the sector that aquired knowledge to **improve** and make **more efficient and sustainable** the existing and future systems and processes.
