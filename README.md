## Welcome to my profile!

I'm Jaime from Spain, I do **Plc programs** üíª to control process like "**State Machines**", "**Cooling‚ùÑÔ∏è and Heating‚òÄÔ∏è Systems**", "**Dosing and Mixing**", "**Preasure Control Systems**" and more. I really enjoy working with technologies such us **TIA PORTAL** and **CODESYS** for Plc programming and motion control. I also have an interest in programming **Arm Robots** with **ABB** and **FANUC** at the moment. I am open to **keep developing myself** and learn anything and everything in this field.
