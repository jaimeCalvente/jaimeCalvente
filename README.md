## Welcome to my profile!

I'm Jaime from Spain. I am an Automation and Control System Technician. I am currently studying an Advanced degree in Cross-platform App development. I create **Plc programs** üíª to control process like "**State Machines**", "**Cooling‚ùÑÔ∏è and Heating‚òÄÔ∏è Systems**", "**Dosing and Mixing**", "**Pressure Control Systems**" and much more. I really enjoy working with technologies such as **STEP7**, **TIA PORTAL**, **CODESYS**, followind IEC Standars and using predominantly the **AWL, FUP and SCL** lenguages.

A part from Plc programming, I enjoy App development in **Android** and **IOS**, and Web development using **React**. 

I also have knowledge with programming lenguages like **C#**, **Java**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS**.

Besides that, I am very keen to **keep developing myself** in anyway, so I can give back to the sector that aquired knowledge to **improve** and make **more efficient and sustainable** the existing and future systems and processes.
