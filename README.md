## Welcome to my profile!

I'm Jaime from Spain. I am an **Automation and Control System Technician**. I'm currently studying an **Advanced degree in Cross-platform App development**. I create **Plc programs** 💻 to control process like "**State Machines**", "**Cooling❄️ and Heating☀️ Systems**", "**Dosing and Mixing**", "**Pressure Control Systems**" and much more. I really enjoy working with technologies such as **STEP7**, **TIA PORTAL**, **CODESYS** and **TWINCAT**, followind IEC Standars and using predominantly the **AWL, FUP and SCL** lenguages.

A part from Plc programming, I enjoy learning new topics such us **Digital Twins with Unity** and **Computer Vision apps with OpenCV**. 

I also have knowledge with programming lenguages like **C#**, **Java**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS**.

Besides that, I am very keen to **keep developing myself** in anyway, so I can give back to the sector that aquired knowledge to **improve** and make **more efficient and sustainable** the existing and future systems and processes.
