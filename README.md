## Welcome to my profile!

I'm Jaime from Spain, I enjoy building **Plc programs** üíª to control process like "**State Machines**", "**Cooling‚ùÑÔ∏è and Heating‚òÄÔ∏è Systems**", "**Dosing and Mixing**", "**Preasure Control Systems**" and more. I really enjoy working with technologies such us **TIA PORTAL**, **CODESYS** and **ROCKWELL** for Plc programming and Motion control.

I am currently studying my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (Online) at the UOC University in Barcelona.

Besides all the above, I am very keen to **keep developing myself** so I can give back to the sector that aquired knowledge to **improve** and make **more efficient and  sustainable** the new or existing systems and processes.
